# Files' purpose

## tokenizer-sample-input.zip

Probably sample input for SourcererCC. Haven't tested it anyway.

## db-importer

Unit tests for tokenizers/file-level/tokenizer.py

## splitquery.sh

Shows some lines statistics

## search\_status.sh

Shows how many processes ended(?)

## runparser.sh

Runs `ant cdparse` and then parser.FileParser for every project in numberedProjects\*

## runexp.sh

Runs `runn.sh`(`run.sh`?) for every project in **pro.txt** which does not exist

## runValidation.sh

Runs validation.CloneBugPattern for every vaibhavsaini's project

## runPostProcessing.sh

Runs postprocessing.ClonesNamesAssembler and postprocessing.ClonesBugsAssembler on vaibhavsaini's projects

## runAggregator.sh

Runs postprocessing.Aggregator on every vaibhavsaini's projects

## run.sh

Runs noindex.CloneDetectorWithFilter many times with different options. No usages found

## mergeindexes.sh

Someway filters repositories by having license and writtent in java and other strange things with smth named "siva"
